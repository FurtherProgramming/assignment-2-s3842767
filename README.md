HotDesk is a program which manages seating arrangements at an office. It allows employees to login and book any available desk to sit in for a period of time. Administrators 
can also manage seating arrangements  by rejecting bookings made by employees or by locking down specific seats to adhere to COVID-19 social distancing protocols.
